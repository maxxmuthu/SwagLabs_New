# SwagLabs_New

## Overview
SwagLabs_New is an advanced test automation project designed to validate the functionality of the Swag Labs application. The project leverages Selenium WebDriver for UI testing, TestNG for test execution, and integrates with TestRail and JIRA for comprehensive test management and defect tracking.

## Project Structure
The repository contains the following key directories and files:

- **.settings**: Configuration settings for the Eclipse IDE.
- **Configuration**: Contains configuration files used for the test automation framework.
- **Logs**: Stores log files generated during test execution.
- **TestData**: Contains test data files used by the tests.
- **src**: Main source directory for the test automation code.
  - **main**:
    - **java/com.swag.base**:
      - `BaseClass`: Core class containing the `setDriver` function which defines whether to use `getRemoteDriver` (for running tests in a virtual machine) or `getLocalDriver` (for running tests on a local machine).
    - **java/com.swag.pageobjects**: Contains all page object classes representing the UI elements and actions for the Swag Labs application.
    - **java/com.swag.utility**:
      - `ExcelReader`: Utility class for reading data from Excel files.
      - `ExtentManager`: Manages the ExtentReports configuration and report generation.
      - `Log`: Utility class for logging detailed execution information using Log4j2.
      - `Utils`: Contains custom utility functions for common actions such as click, getText, sendKeys, etc.
      - `APIClient`, `APIException`, `TestRailManager`: Classes for integrating with TestRail to update test case results.
      - `JiraIssueCreator`: Automates the creation of JIRA issues for failed test cases.
      - `TestNGListener`: Implements TestNG listeners for updating test statuses in TestRail and logging test execution details.
  - **test**: Contains all test scenarios, structured to facilitate easy addition and management of tests.
- **target**: Directory for compiled code and other build artifacts generated by Maven.
- **test-output**: Stores output from TestNG, including detailed HTML and XML test reports.
- **.classpath**: Eclipse classpath configuration file.
- **.project**: Eclipse project configuration file.
- **azure-pipeline.yaml**: Configuration file for setting up CI/CD pipelines in Azure.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Configuration file for setting up Docker containers.
- **jenkins-pipeline.txt**: Jenkins pipeline configuration script for CI/CD.
- **log4j2.xml**: Log4j2 configuration file for logging settings.
- **pom.xml**: Maven Project Object Model file for managing dependencies and build configurations.
- **testng.xml**: TestNG suite configuration file for defining test suites, groups, and parameters.

## Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Maven
- TestNG
- Selenium WebDriver
- TestRail (for test management integration)
- JIRA (for defect tracking integration)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/maxxmuthu/SwagLabs_New.git
   cd SwagLabs_New

2. Install Dependencies
   mvn clean install

3. Running Tests
   Execute the following command to run the tests:
   mvn test

Continuous Integration
Azure Pipelines: The azure-pipeline.yaml file contains the necessary configuration for setting up a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps.

Jenkins: Use the jenkins-pipeline.txt file to configure your Jenkins pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.

Docker:
To start the services using Docker Compose:
docker-compose up

Logging
Logs are configured using Log4j2 and stored in the Logs directory. The log4j2.xml file defines the logging levels and appenders.

Test Data
Test data is stored in the TestData directory and can be accessed using the ExcelReader utility class.

Integration with TestRail and JIRA
TestRail: The project includes classes (APIClient, APIException, TestRailManager) for integrating with TestRail. These classes help in updating the test case results in TestRail automatically after the test execution.
JIRA: The JiraIssueCreator class automates the creation of JIRA issues for any test case failures, enabling seamless defect tracking.
